# TRG_D4_symmetry

This repository provides numerical details of the paper "Fixed-point tensor is a CFT four-point function" by A.Ueda and M.Yamazaki.
Preprocess data are available in the directories "/fptensor" and "/Gauge-fixed". 
If you would like to compute the data by yourself, "Data_collection.ipynb" gives the instructions.

The main figures in our paper are plotted in "TRG_analysis.ipynb".
